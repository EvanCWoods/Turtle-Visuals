# Turtle-Visuals

Repository to store code used in learning the Turtle library.

##Explaination:
A simple application that uses Turtle to test different math functions in a visual way. In this case, using randomization in all aspects of the functionality, besides the angle and size of shape. The code runs to perform a set of drawings that resemple fireworks, all with randomly selected RGB colors and in randomly selected locations on the screen.

#Future Development:
Future development opportunities include connecting the app to a website where a user can tune the variables used to visualise different math functions (eg sin waves) in an interactive way to promote easy learning of mathemetical concepts.
